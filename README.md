# Emotion-Classification
This project compares LSTM and GRU models for detecting emotions in EEG signals. LSTM shows better accuracy, making it ideal for precise classification. However, GRU, with lower computational needs, is a practical alternative when resources are limited. The GRU model is slightly less accurate but still a viable option.
